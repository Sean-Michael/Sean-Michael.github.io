        I am a Computer Science Student at Oregon State University. 
        Passionate about computer hardware and consumer electronics, I initially came to OSU to study Electrical and Computer Engineering.
        Through my coursework I learned that I was much more interested in Computer Science because I saw it as an exceptional creative outlet. 
        Since then I've changed my major to Computer Science Systems, but still maintain a keen interest in hardware.

        My favorite courses so far have been: Web Development, Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming, and Computer Graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always open to making new connections and finding opportunities.
