            <li><i>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you work through them?</i></li>
            <p> Overall completing the basic requirements of this assignment was no challenge. 
                The main issue I ran into was getting Github Pages to recognize my CSS style sheet.
                I'm honestly still not sure what was wrong but after much googling and troubleshooting I finally got it to work.
                I learned from a Github forum that I needed to specify "type = 'tex/css" in my relative link.
                I also ran into some trouble using Visual Studio on my desktop windows machine and my Linux laptop with Github. 
                I seem to have messed up my repos to the point that neither of them will sync with the master.</p>

            <li><i>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</i></li>
            <p> In working on this assignment I learned about using CSS for styling an HTML page.
                I also learned about using Github pages and the OSU ENGR servers to host my own websites.
                I had some prior experience with basic HTML though it was based on modifying pre-made templates in dreamweaver not starting from scratch.
                I was also familiar with using Git and Github for storing code in repositories.</p>

            <li><i>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</i></li>
            <p> The primary resource i used throughout this assignment was the lecture notes provided on the class website.
                I found these notes to be the most helpful resource in addition to the example code because they were very easy to understand and utilize.
                I also consulted the Github forums for help troubleshooting my issues with Github pages not using my CSS file, a common issue.

            <h2><a href="bennys_list.html"><em>Assignment_2:</em></a> 10/26/2020</h2>
         <ul>
             <li><i>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</i></li>
             <p>The most challenging element of this assignment was seeing what I needed to accomplish but not fully knowing how to go about it and what tools were at my disposal. 
                 I had some knowledge of CSS from lecture and the notes but putting it into practice was totally different. 
                 I mostly solved the problems I had by googling them or referencing the lecture notes.
                 More often than not however I used trial and error to figure stuff out on my own which was really fun.
            </p>
 
             <li><i>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</i></li>
             <p> I learned a whole lot about CSS and flex boxes. The flex boxes were really cool to use because they made formatting so easy!
                 I already knew some of the text styling stuff, but most everything else was completely new.
             </p>
 
             <li><i>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</i></li>
             <p> I found the w3schools and Mozilla tutorial websites to be the most helpful outside of the class notes on CSS which were a lifesaver. 
                 I mostly used the outside resources to get some syntax and understand what options I had that weren't fully covered in the class notes. 
                 I found the Firefox Inspect Element feature to be incredibly helpful in debuggin, understanding what my CSS was translating to in the actual webpage was a big help. 
             </p>
             <li><i>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</i></li>
             <p>One thing I had to google was how to turn the button into a circle. I also had to google how to position the button so that it stayed on the page.

             <li><i>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</i></li>
             <p>The most challenging element of this assignment was the javascript to allow for filtering. It was tough to get all of the if statement logic working correctly. 
            </p>
 
             <li><i>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</i></li>
             <p>  I learned everything about javascript that I now know from this assignment. Before this assignment I had never used javascript. I already knew a lot of programming techniques however which were useful for thinking about how to solve the problems. 
             </p>
 
             <li><i>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</i></li>

                 I mostly used the outside resources to get some syntax and understand what options I had that weren't fully covered in the class notes. 
                 I found the Firefox Inspect Element feature to be incredibly helpful in debuggin javascript using console.log().
             </p>
             <li><i>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</i></li>
             <p>I had to google how to force a variable to be a integer for the filtering functions using a built in Javascript function I didn't know about.
