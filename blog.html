            <li><i>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you work through them?</i></li>
            <p> Overall completing the basic requirements of this assignment was no challenge. 
                The main issue I ran into was getting Github Pages to recognize my CSS style sheet.
                I'm honestly still not sure what was wrong but after much googling and troubleshooting I finally got it to work.
                I learned from a Github forum that I needed to specify "type = 'tex/css" in my relative link.
                I also ran into some trouble using Visual Studio on my desktop windows machine and my Linux laptop with Github. 
                I seem to have messed up my repos to the point that neither of them will sync with the master.</p>

            <li><i>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</i></li>
            <p> In working on this assignment I learned about using CSS for styling an HTML page.
                I also learned about using Github pages and the OSU ENGR servers to host my own websites.
                I had some prior experience with basic HTML though it was based on modifying pre-made templates in dreamweaver not starting from scratch.
                I was also familiar with using Git and Github for storing code in repositories.</p>

            <li><i>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</i></li>
            <p> The primary resource i used throughout this assignment was the lecture notes provided on the class website.
                I found these notes to be the most helpful resource in addition to the example code because they were very easy to understand and utilize.
                I also consulted the Github forums for help troubleshooting my issues with Github pages not using my CSS file, a common issue.
